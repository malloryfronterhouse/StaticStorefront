                    <h2 id="title">Beginner's Guide to Sustainablity:</h2>
                    <p class="content">Hey there friends! Let's have a little chat about sustainability. I know that word can seem very intimidating. Not to mention, prior to my own introduction to sustainablity, the mental image I had of people striving for a zero-waste lifestyle was someone with dreds that hasn't showered in a month and chases you down to sign their Greenpeace petition. This couldn't be further from the truth (generally...). The only requirement for sustainablity is that you strive your best to make purchases with the product/brands enivronmental impact at the forefront of your mind. Sounds easy enough right?
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">Well it can be a little tricky and if you don't know what a sustainable vs unsustainable brand/item looks like, then queue a sea of confusion. So what does sustainablity look like? It looks like a glass bottle to hold cleaning chemicals, as opposed to plastic. It looks like bamboo toothbrushes that will eventually biodegrade rather than plastic ones that will sit in a landfill. No one-I repeat NO ONE-wakes up the morning after they decide to live a sustainable lifestyle and suddenly is rid of their unsustainable items. The key thing to keep in mind is that transitioning to a sustainable lifestyle takes <i>time and patience</i>. Go slow. Take it in bite size chunks. You're more likely to maintain these lifestyle changes if they are managable. So maybe swap out your plastic packaged deodorant for a sustainably packaged one <b>only after you've finished the old one.</b> This may seem counter-intuitive at first; however, throwing out usable (albeit unsustainable) products to replace them with sustainable ones is not sustainable. Can you guess why?</p>
                    <p class="content">If you guessed "because it's wasteful" then you got it right! Only replace products as you run out of the unsustainable counterpart.</p>
                    <p class="content">Finally, I have one more sustainablity tip for you beginners out there who feel daunted by the zero-waste world. Try not set harsh standards for yourself. No one is perfect and that's absolutely true in this lifestyle as well. Sometimes your budgetary constraints may not allow for you to purchase certain sustainable swaps. Maybe these items aren't readily accessible in your geographical locations. And sometimes we just prefer the more disposable option. That's all okay! YOU get to decide what sustainablity looks like for you! That's the beauty of this whole deal. So I hope that our store serves as a great jumping off point for your entrance into the world of sustainablity! Happy shopping friends and remember to #shopsmall!</p>
